description: How do I prepare for this certification
---
Before I join Amazon, I've heard so many great things about AWS. In fact, this is the main reason I decided to apply and join this company.
It is not until I started my career at Amazon that I realized the potential of AWS, and how it
revolutionize the way people develop software.

In the mean time, one of my colleague at Amazon has recommanded me a AWS certification: Solution Architect - Associate. In the beginning, I was doubtful. I am already inside of Amazon, why should I take another certification?

However, after some consideration, I registered for a exam in the following month. There are several reason that drove me to take this certification.
1. I want to know AWS better. Although I worked with AWS in my daily development, there are so many services in AWS I never get the chance to know
2. Architecting is not a easy topic. As a developer, building a elastic cloud architecture is not trivial. You need to know the main concepts on the cloud, and to familiar yourself with
cloud design patterns.
3. This certification is actually widely accepted, even inside of Amazon. I believe that this certification provide me with a alternative in my career -- cloud solution architect.
4. Last but not the least, it forces me to prepare for those topics in AWS. Remember, taking this certification is not free, and this often drives people to prepare for the certification.

As Amazon employee, you have a lot of internal resources to help you study for this certification, but what I found most useful is a website available for the general public -- [aws.training](https://aws.training). I've taken a online course to help myself prepare for this certification. Also, [qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) offers many online labs for AWs trainings. Those resources help me to dive deep into AWS.

However, the most useful tool to learn about AWS is AWS itself. I started to build this blog on AWS recently, and it has been a great success. I managed to deploy a Gatsby static website to S3 bucket, together with Cloudfront setup. You can find my website source [here](https://github.com/DengYiping/blogging). I also started to work on a side project that will allow visiters to make comments in my blogs. I leveraged serverless architecture and now this project is close to complete.

During the study, I had several pitfalls in between. There are several things you need to remember when preparing for the exam:
- Do not fall into a trap of learning all AWS services. In the exam, only widely used AWS services will show up. E.g.: I don't believe that AWS Ground Station will ever show up in the exam
- Exam questions are all case-study question. They will never ask you about the exact number, but you should be familiar with those number to make decisions.
- Make sure your study material is up-to-date. I've found many AWS study material outdated. Please check AWS documents and use it as a reference.

During the exam, there are several things you need to keep in mingd:
- It is a computer exam, and it is purely multiple choice questions
- You can flag a question for review later in the top-right corner
- 65 questions / 140 minutes, so roughly 2 minutes per question
- In order to pass, you need to have the right answer for roughly 70% of the question
- Immediately after the exam, you will know if you achieve the certification. 
- Your detailed result will be sent to you in 5 business days.

In general, I believe that with 1 month of proper study, you can achieve this certification.
